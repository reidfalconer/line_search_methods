# The Algorithmic Showdown:
## Gradient Descent vs Newton's Method

#### 14D002: Deterministic Models and Optimization.

### By: Reid Falconer 

This project seeks to determine how two line search methods perform relative to each other (e.g. in convergence rate
or the number of iterations needed) and to further assess the differences in the execution of first order and second order optimisation as the algorithms scales with n.

- Gradient descent 
- Newton's method
